# Lumen
Collaborative demo of CPU scheduling algorithms  FCFS  implemented in Python. Includes Gantt charts, performance metrics (waiting time &amp; turnaround time), and Git collaboration workflow with commits, pulls, and merges.


## Assignment Instructions

### Task
Illustrate any CPU Scheduling Algorithm (FCFS, SJF, or Round Robin) using any tool of your choice (Python, C, Excel, Google Sheets, Java, JavaScript, or even a diagram tool).  

A banking system processes customer transactions in the order they arrive...

### Git Workflow
1. **Student A**: Create a new GitHub Repository. Add Student B as a collaborator.  
2. **Student B**: Clone the repository locally. Implement Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling. Commit & Push changes.  
3. **Student A**: Implement First Come First Serve (FCFS) scheduling. Commit & Push changes.  
4. **Student B**: Pull the updated repository. Implement Round Robin (RR) scheduling. Commit & Push changes.  
5. **Both Students**: Merge all contributions into the main branch.  

### Deliverables
- GitHub Repository Link with:  
  1. Code / files of all 3 algorithms.  
  2. Final README.md documentation.  
  3. Git history showing collaboration.
